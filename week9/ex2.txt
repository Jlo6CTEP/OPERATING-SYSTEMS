To increase hit/miss ratio i used sequence with repetitions, that is not separated by big "distance". 
It means, that we load page into memory when we need it, do all possible stuff with it and unload, and then never load it again

To decrease hit/miss ratio we need load-unload pages as much as we can, so the best option here will be sequence with no repetitions at all, 
which will give us 0.0 hit/miss ratio.
